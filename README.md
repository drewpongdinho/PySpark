# Analysing Walmart Stocks Data using PySpark and Docker

## Description
This project demonstrates how to use PySpark, Spark SQL, and Docker to analyse Walmart stock data. It showcases the use of Apache Spark's distributed computing capabilities for processing large datasets efficiently. By leveraging Spark SQL, we can perform SQL-like operations on the data and gain valuable insights into Walmart's stock performance.

## To run this project, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. Follow the instructions specific to your operating system to install Docker:

- Docker for Windows
- Docker for Mac
- Usage

## Follow these steps to use Docker to analyse Walmart stock data using PySpark:
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/drewpongdinho/PySpark.git
</pre>

Navigate to the project directory:
<pre>
cd PySpark 
</pre>

Build the Docker image by running the following command:
<pre>
docker build -t pyspark-walmart-analysis.
</pre>
        
Start a Docker container with the built image:
<pre>
docker run -it pyspark-walmart-analysis
</pre>
        
Once inside the container, execute the PySpark script to perform the analysis:
<pre>
spark-submit pyspark_walmart_stock_analysis.py
</pre>
        
The PySpark script will utilise Spark SQL to analyze the Walmart stock data. Customise the script as needed to explore different aspects of the dataset.
# Data
The Walmart stock data used in this project is provided in the data directory. It consists of historical stock prices in CSV format. The dataset includes columns such as date, open, high, low, close, volume, and adjusted close.

Feel free to use your own Walmart stock data or modify the existing dataset to suit your needs.

# Features
Spark SQL Analysis: Utilise Spark SQL to perform various analytical operations on the Walmart stock data, such as aggregations, filtering, sorting, and joining.
Data Visualisation: Generate visualizations using PySpark's integration with popular Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to gain insights into the stock data.
Machine Learning: Apply machine learning algorithms available in PySpark's MLlib to forecast stock prices or perform other predictive analysis tasks.

In this updated README, I've focused on using Docker to run the PySpark analysis. I've also added sections specifically discussing the Walmart stock data, the features of the project, and the potential for data visualisation and machine learning. Feel free to modify and customize this template to best suit your project's requirements.
